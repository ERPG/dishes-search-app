## Getting Started

This steps will get you through the setup process of installing and usage of the project.

### Project installation guide

To ensure the best compatibility you may need node version of `v10.17`. We would recommend to use NVM (Node Version Manager) for this. You can find it [Here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Installation

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

then you can run

```
nvm install `version`
```

If you already have `nvm` installed just run

```
nvm use
```

This will set node version on .nvmrc


After set node version run

```
yarn install
```

To run the project

```
yarn run start
```

That's it, you are good to go!
